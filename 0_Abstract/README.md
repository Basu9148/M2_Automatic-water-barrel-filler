A relative asked me if I could create something that automates refilling a water barrel used for watering a small garden greenhouse. They didn’t want to plug in a pump every few hours only to have turn it off again ten minutes later when it has filled up again. So I’ve scavenged some stuff that I had lying around to create a project and decided to make a instructable so that other people might get some inspiration from it.
Since I didn’t want to mess with the cable connected to the pump, I decided to modify an old power strip in a way so that it could be controlled by a microcontroller. this might prove useful in other projects as well.

I also did not want the pump to switch on/off every second because of the water level jumping above and below a certain threshold. To fix this I used 2 float switches, one which is the maximum water level and one forthe minimum water level.
